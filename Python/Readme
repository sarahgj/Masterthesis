colorlines_Flex.py: 
Tracks the particles on a map, and uses color to indicate height or mass.

cruisetracks.py:
Plots the cruicetrack on a map, and uses color to indicate different variables.

dship.py:
Has the two modules: read_M91 and read_ASTRA to read in data from the dship.

entrainedTTP_Flex.py:
Calculates the amount of particles entrained at 17 km height.

entrainment_plot.py:
Plots the amount that is entraied and the percentrage that is entrained, and the amount that is released. 

entrainment_plot_extra.py:
Same as above, but also calculates mean, max, min etc. etrainment for table.

FlexParticle.py:
Program that reads the Flexpart output files.

fluxes_plot.py:
Program that plots the calculated fluxes of the VSLS.

latex_plots.py:
Has the module: newfig and subplot that both adjust the figures so that the text is the right size for a latex document.

lifetimeprofile_plot.py:
Plots the lifetime of the VSLS with height as used in Flexpart.

released_entrained_correlation.py:
Plots this correletion for the VSLS from Flexpart output.

specify.py:
Includes the module: Specify that reads from the command line: cruice and substance, and gives out names etc. 

tripletsaxis_plot.py:
same as entrainment_plot.py but with three y-axis.
